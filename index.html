        About Me
    </div>

    <p>
        What do I know about coding? Not much. What I do know is anything 
        can be learned with time and effort. My background is in healthcare
        (Radiology and Radiation Therapy) and wellness (Yoga). I've enjoyed 
         each and every of those occupations but I came to a point where I felt
        it was time to explore a different career path that would allow me more
        time and freedom to enjoy life. So here I am and here you are.
